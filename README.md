SeenIt
Web service that allows your users to delete their media once they have watched it.
This connects to Ombi, Radarr and Sonarr to delete the requests in Ombi, and the movies/series from Radarr/Sonarr. This is to allow users to submit the same series again afterwards.
I am learning Python Flask with this, so do not expect high quality code!
