        Hello {{ current_user.alias }}!<br>
        <br>
        Here are some statistics : <br>
        <div style="margin: 1em;">
            You have {{ movie_picks_count + tv_show_picks_count }} Picks :<br>
            - {{ movie_picks_count }} Movies. Using a total of {{ total_movie_size | filesizeformat }}. This is {{ (total_movie_size / total_available_space * 100) | round(1) }}% of the total storage. <br>
            - {{ tv_show_picks_count }} TV Shows. Using a total of {{ total_tv_show_size | filesizeformat }}. This is {{ (total_tv_show_size / total_available_space * 100) | round(1) }}% of the total storage. <br>
            <br>
    {% endif %}
            Medias are using {{ total_used_space | filesizeformat }} out of the ~{{ total_available_space | filesizeformat }} available. <br>
            {{ (total_used_space / total_available_space * 100) | round(1) }}% of the storage is used. About {{ (total_available_space-total_used_space) | filesizeformat }} remaining.<br>
            {{ total_space_to_be_freed | filesizeformat }} will be deleted on {{ moment(delete_date).format('LL') }}.<br>
        </div>

    <br>
    <br>
    This application will assign picks to you for media (movie or TV show) through different ways :<br>
    - Requested the media through Ombi<br>
    - Watched the media through Plex<br>
    - Picked up a media that was abandonned<br>
    <br>
    For the same media, you can let it go so that it has a chance to be deleted.<br>
    If everyone lets go of a media, it will be abandonned and will have a chance to be picked up by someone before getting deleted.<br>
